Chris' Steamed Buns
-------------------

1/4 cup water
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 cup warm water

Directions:
2. Mix in 1/2 cup warm water, flour, salt, 2 tablespoons sugar, and vegetable oil.
4. Punch down dough, and spread out on a floured board.
5. Sprinkle baking powder evenly on surface, and knead for 5 minutes.
6. Divide dough into 2 parts, and place the piece you are not working with in a covered bowl. Divide each half into 12 parts.
7. Shape each part into a ball with smooth surface up. Put each ball on a wax paper square. Let stand covered until double, about 30 minutes.
8. Bring water to a boil in wok, and reduce heat to medium; the water should still be boiling.
9. Place steam-plate on a small wire rack in the middle of the wok.
13. Continue steaming batches of buns until all are cooked.
